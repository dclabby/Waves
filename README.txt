This repository contains wavetoolbox.py and associated scripts used in its development & verification.

The motivation for this repo was primarily to developed my experience with object oriented programming in python. I also tried to avoid loops and instead use matrix operations. 

Also, given that the topic of wave analysis is very familiar to me, I thought it would be interesting to transfer some of the many scripts that I've written in Matlab over to Python.
